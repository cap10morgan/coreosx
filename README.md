coreosx
=======

## Installation

CoreOS on OS X in three steps:

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

2. Put the `coreosx` script somewhere on your path:

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cap10morgan/coreosx/v1.0.1/coreosx > /usr/local/bin/coreosx
        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/coreosx

3. Run:

        coreosx shell
        docker version (or etcdctl ls or fleetctl list-machines)


This script acts as both an installer and as Virtual machine manager. On first run, it installs and starts a CoreOS virtual machine. It forwards ports 4001 and 7001 from the host's localhost interface to the VM for etcd clients to connect to. It also (optionally) adds an entry to /etc/hosts called `localcoreos` for accessing exposed ports from Docker containers, for example.

The virtual machine that Docker runs on is given the hostname `localcoreos`. For example, if you run `docker run -p 8000:8000 ...`, then that will be available at `localcoreos:8000` from OS X.

## After Installation

Instead of running `coreosx shell` all the time, it's much more convenient to
add this to your shell's init file (~/.profile or similar):

    eval `coreosx env`

If you don't have them already, you'll probably want to install the docker client, etcdctl, and fleetctl
on your OS X host. The simplest way to do that is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

    brew install docker
    brew install etcdctl
    brew install fleetctl

Once installed, they should Just Work as long as your CoreOS VM is running and you have eval'd `coreosx env`
in your shell (or run `coreosx shell` first).

## Additional commands

`coreosx` provide additional commands as shortcuts for controlling the Vagrant VM:

### coreosx start

Start the local Virtual Machine

### coreosx ssh

Open a console on the Vagrant virtual machine.

### coreosx destroy

Destroy the local Virtual Machine

### coreosx halt

Stop the Vagrant VM. You'll probably want to do this after you've finished working with CoreOS to save RAM.

### coreosx shell

Start the virtual machine and open a shell with DOCKER_HOST environment variable configured.


## Override defaults

The coreosx script has several options that can be overridden by adding a
new file `$HOME/.coreosx/defaults`. When coreosx starts the VM, it will
source this file.

When modifying the defaults for coreosx, currently, it is best to destroy
any already-created VM and configure a new one with the changes.

An example `defaults` file follows:

```bash
# $HOME/.coreosx/defaults
COREOS_IP=192.168.228.10
```

### COREOS_IP

The IP that the docker host will be mapped to on your machine.

Default: `172.16.23.75`

### COREOS_DOMAIN

The domain name added to `/etc/hosts`, pointing at the `COREOS_IP`.

Default: `localcoreos`

### DOCKER_PORT

The port that docker will be listening on.

Default: `2375`

### COREOS_CHANNEL

The initial version of CoreOS will be installed from this release and updates will come from it afterwards.

Default: `alpha`

### VAGRANT_BOX_URL

The URL used to download the vagrant box.

Default: `http://${COREOS_CHANNEL}.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_vagrant.json`
